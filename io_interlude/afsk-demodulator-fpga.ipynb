    "# AFSK Demodulator\n",
    "## Step 5: Hardware I/O Interlude\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we take a brief break from the AFSK demodulator project to play around with the I/O features of the Pynq board.  We will be making use of these features in the coming segments.  This is a good time to learn how to use the buttons and switches -- and LEDs -- on the Pynq board.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.  However, this section is completely stand-alone.  It does not depend on any of the previous work like most of the other sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to help further our migration of the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  In the next section we are going to implement the Digital PLL.  When the PLL is locked, we have detected a data carrier.  We will use this lock indicator to signal \"data carrier detection\" by turning on an LED on when the PLL is locked, and turning it off when it is unlocked.  To do that, we need to first learn how to interact with the digital I/O interfaces on the Pynq board.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to need a file from the TUL web side called a device constraints file (XDC).\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.tul.com.tw/download/pynq-z2_v1.0.xdc.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not using a Pynq Z2, you will need to get the proper XDC file for your board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not really need to have done anything further with the demodulator project.  This is a fairly stand-alone project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are goint to learn to interact with some of the I/O components which are attached to the PL of the Pynq board.  We are going to use the push buttons and the 4 green LEDs.  We are also going to trigger an interrupt on the PS and use the asynchronous I/O features of Python and Pynq.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to create PL code that implements a 4-bit counter, displaying the binary values in the green LEDs on the Pynq board, and using the push buttons near the LEDs for input.  We will have an Up/Down button pair, a Reset to Zero button, and a Data Ready button which we will use to indicate to the PS that a value is ready to be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that reads the buttons as input, writes to the LEDs as output, has an AXI interface to the counter, and a return value that indicates to the PS to read the counter.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file.\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Import the XDC file and modify it to expose the LEDs and buttons we will be using.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works.\n"

    "## Vivado HLS\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we are going to write will be fairly simple. However, there are a few things we have to do that may not be obvious, and there are a few things I learned about HLS during this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are going to be reading button presses, and the buttons we will be using are not debounced in hardware, we need to implement a debounce function for our keys.  Mechanical switches are noisy.  A switch does not make a clean jump from OFF to ON.  At high resolution, there are a lot of on/off transitions that occur during a button press.  We need to ignore those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debounce is implemented by having a key press trigger a counter that waits a short time before reading the key value.  This causes all of the make/break noise to be ignored.  In an FPGA, this is partly implemented using a state machine.  The states are \"waiting for a key press\", \"waiting for debounce\", and \"debounce complete\". The \"debounce complete\" state has a very quick transition back to \"waiting for key press\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We could debounce each key separately, but there is no need for that and it wastes PL resources.  We can debounce all of the keys at once.  Luckily, this is easy for us to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient implementation of this code is tricky.  My first attempt at it was estimated to take well over 1000 LUTS.  That's a lot for something as simple as this.  Efficient implementation of the debounce state machine and of the main loop takes a bit of work.  The end result uses 31/42 LUTs/FFs after Vivado synthesis, although the HLS synthesis step estimated it would use 264/98.  The estimated number of LUTs was off by an order of magnitude.\n",

    " 1. Start Vivado HLS.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vivado_hls\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " 1. Create a new project under the project_07 directory call HLS.\n",
    " 1. Create a top-level function called count.\n",
    " 1. Create 2 new files:\n",
    "    * [count.hpp](HLS/count.hpp)\n",
    "    * [count.cpp](HLS/count.cpp)\n",
