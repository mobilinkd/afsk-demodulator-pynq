    "# AFSK Demodulator\n",
    "## Step 5: Digital PLL\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline the steps necessary to move the Digital PLL to FPGA.  This will be our largest and most complex project yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to continue our migration of the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  We will be streaming audio data into the FPGA and streaming processed data out from the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third step of moving a demodulator processing step into the FPGA. At this point demodulation is being done in FPGA.  We are left with clock recovery and HDLC framing.  Here we address clock recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we must diverge from the design pattern we have been following.  No longer are we simply streaming data in and out.  The PLL had to indicate *lock* status, it has to output a *sample* indicator.  And it may need to output information about *jitter* for diagnostic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital PLL in Python provides all of these interfaces.  However, we can change the interface.  We only need to provide two outputs from the PLL: a stream of sampled bits, and a lock indicator.  Audio data will be clocked in via a stream interface.  This will be demodulated to a bitstream and processed by the digital PLL.  The demodulator will clock out 3 bits for each audio sample: the demodulated bit, the a lock flag, and a sample indicator.  The sample indicator will never go high if the lock flag is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Python implementation of the PLL that we need an IIR filter and a hysteresis module.  We will build and test these independently.  The PLL also made use of floating point math in the PLL, IIR filter and hysteresis code.  We will change that to fixed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    " * Familiarized yourself with the AFSK demodulator implementation in Python.\n",
    " * Completed the first four steps of the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the process of creating a streaming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to modify the FPGA IP we created in the third tutorial to add the low-pass filter for the correlator output we are now generating, and turn that back into a bitstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that accepts a block of 16-bit data, performs the FIR, correlator and low-pass filter operations,  and sends the resulting bitstream back.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file.\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works.\n",
    " 1. Integrate the FPGA module with the existing demodulator code, replacing the existing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to generate the FIR filter coefficients.  Then we are going to generate some sample data for our test bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "With the code below we will generate and output the coefficients for the band pass filter."

We changed the data types used by the filter coefficients, reducing their size to just what is needed.  This makes our core more efficient.\n",

    " 1. On the right side, in the Flow Navigator, select *Create Block Diagram*.\n",
    " 1. Use the default name, design_1.\n",
    " 1. Go into Tools|Settings.\n",
    "    1. In the settings dialog, choose IP|Repository.\n",
    "    1. Select \"+\" to add a repository.\n",
    "    1. Add Project_04/HLS as a repository.  You should see that it has 1 IP called `demodulate4` in there.\n",
    "    1. When done, click \"OK\".\n",
    " 1. In the Diagram view (main window) select \"+\" to add IP.\n",
