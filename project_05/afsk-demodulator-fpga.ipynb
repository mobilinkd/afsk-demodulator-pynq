    "# AFSK Demodulator\n",
    "## Step 5: Digital PLL\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline the steps necessary to move the Digital PLL to FPGA.  This will be our largest and most complex project yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to continue our migration of the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  We will be streaming audio data into the FPGA and streaming processed data out from the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third step of moving a demodulator processing step into the FPGA. At this point demodulation is being done in FPGA.  We are left with clock recovery and HDLC framing.  Here we address clock recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we must diverge from the design pattern we have been following.  No longer are we simply streaming data in and out.  The PLL had to indicate *lock* status, it has to output a *sample* indicator.  And it may need to output information about *jitter* for diagnostic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital PLL in Python provides all of these interfaces.  However, we can change the interface.  We only need to provide two outputs from the PLL: a stream of sampled bits, and a lock indicator.  Audio data will be clocked in via a stream interface.  This will be demodulated to a bitstream and processed by the digital PLL.  The demodulator will clock out 3 bits for each audio sample: the demodulated bit, the a lock flag, and a sample indicator.  The sample indicator will never go high if the lock flag is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Python implementation of the PLL that we need an IIR filter and a hysteresis module.  We will build and test these independently.  The PLL also made use of floating point math in the PLL, IIR filter and hysteresis code.  We will change that to fixed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    " * Familiarized yourself with the AFSK demodulator implementation in Python.\n",
    " * Completed the first four steps of the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the process of creating a streaming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to modify the FPGA IP we created in the third tutorial to add the low-pass filter for the correlator output we are now generating, and turn that back into a bitstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that accepts a block of 16-bit data, performs the FIR, correlator and low-pass filter operations,  and sends the resulting bitstream back.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file.\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works.\n",
    " 1. Integrate the FPGA module with the existing demodulator code, replacing the existing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to generate the FIR filter coefficients.  Then we are going to generate some sample data for our test bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to generate the filter coefficents, because we still need to test against the Python implementation.  But we no longer need to print them out.  Our work with filters is complete.  We now focus on the digitl PLL."

    " 1. Start Vivado and create a new project.\n",
    " 1. Give it a path -- in our case `afsk-demodulator-pynq/project_05` and the name `Vivado`.\n",
    " 1. Select the `RTL Project` project type.\n",
    " 1. In the \"Default Part\" screen, switch to the \"Boards\" tab. Select the your board from the list.\n",
    " 1. Click \"Finish\".\n",
    " \n",
    "With the new project open in Vivado, we need to create a block design.  We are going to follow the exact some procedure we did in the first three.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. On the right side, in the Flow Navigator, select *Create Block Diagram*.\n",
    " 1. Use the default name, design_1.\n",
    " 1. Go into Tools|Settings.\n",
    "    1. In the settings dialog, choose IP|Repository.\n",
    "    1. Select \"+\" to add a repository.\n",
    "    1. Add Project_05/HLS as a repository.  You should see that it has 1 IP called `demodulate5` in there.\n",
    "    1. When done, click \"OK\".\n",
    " 1. In the Diagram view (main window) select \"+\" to add IP.\n",
    " 1. Add the Zynq processing system and run block automation.\n",
    " 1. When done, double-click the Zynq block and find the *High-performance AXI Slave Ports*.\n",
    " 1. Click on the High-performance AXI Slave Ports.\n",
    " 1. Enable the *S AXI HP0 interface*, then click OK.\n",
    " 1. Add an AXI Stream Interconnect, AXI Direct Memory Access and the demodulator IP.\n",
    " 1. Open the AXI Direct Memory Access, disable scatter/gather, and set the stream widths to 16 bits.\n",
    " 1. Wire up the demodulator to the AXI Direct Memory Access and run connection automation.\n",
    "    * A few additional modules are added: AXI SmartConnect, AXI Interconnect, and Processor System Reset\n",
    "![BlockDiagram](BlockDiagram.png)\n",
    " 1. Rename the demodulator block to \"demodulate\" and the DMA block to \"dma\".\n",
    " 1. Combine the demodulate and dma blocks into a hierarchy called \"demodulator\".\n",
    " 1. Generate the HDL wrapper by clicking on the design in the Sources box, right clicking, and selecting \"Generate HDL Wrapper\".\n",
    " 1. Generate the bitstream. Again, this will take some time.\n",
    " 1. Export the block design (File|Export|Export Block Design...)\n",

    "    - design_1.tcl\n",
    "    * rename these file to \"project_03.{ext}\" so that you have project_05.bit, project_05.tcl and project_05.hwh\n",
    " 1. On the mounted Pynq filesystem, copy these files to `pynq/overlays/afsk_demodulator/`.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
