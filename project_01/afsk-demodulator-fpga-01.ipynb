    "## Step 1: Basic AXI Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline the steps necessary to create a basic AXI streaming solution in Vivado HLS and use that solution in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to serve as the foundation for migrating the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  We will be streaming audio data into the FPGA and streaming processed data out from the FPGA.  In the beginning we will be streaming in audio data from WAV files, and streaming out processed audio data.  When we get to the point of implementing the digital PLL and HDLC, we will be streaming out PLL data, or just the decoded HDLC packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do any of this, however, we need to ensure we have a framework for getting data into and out of the FPGA.  The Zynq SOC uses AXI interfaces to communicate between the processing system (PS) and the programmable logic (PL).\n",
    "From this point on we will use *PL* and *PS* to refer to the two distict halves of the Zynq SOC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    " * Familiarized yourself with the AFSK demodulator implementation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have a PYNQ Z2, you may have to adjust some of the code in later sections to match your board.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am running Vivado on Linux.  It should work on Windows as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Housekeeping\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we need to address some basic configuration items that will make our lives easier going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting the PYNQ Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to need to copy files between our workstation running Vivado and the PYNQ board.  To do that, we are going to mount the board on our computer.  On Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo mkdir /run/media/${USER}/PYNQ && sudo mount -t cifs -o \"uid=1000,username=xilinx,password=xilinx\" //pynq/xilinx /run/media/${USER}/PYNQ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, you should now see a PYNQ mount point in your file browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vivado Board Support\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have added a board description file for your development board to Vivado while going through the setup process and tutorials mentioned as prerequisites. For the Pynq-Z2, that means downloading the [board file](https://d2m32eurp10079.cloudfront.net/Download/pynq-z2.zip) and installing the files in `Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/data/boards/board_files`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vivado HLS Board Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding support for your board to Vivado HLS is not as straight-forward as it is to add support for the board to Vivado, but for repeated use of Vivado HLS, it is worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Edit ```Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/common/config/VivadoHls_boards.xml```\n",
    " 1. Add ```<board name=\"PYNQ_Z2\" display_name=\"PYNQ Z2 Development Kit\" family=\"zynq\" part=\"xc7z020clg400-1\"  device=\"xc7z020\" package=\"clg400\" speedgrade=\"-1\" vendor=\"http://www.tul.com.tw\" />``` just inside the \"platform\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vivado Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Source the Vivado shell configuration files to ensure your shell environment is configured so that you and Vivado can find the Xilinx components.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ". Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/settings64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you move the Xilinx installation, like I tried to do, the configuration scripts will point to the original installation directory and your shell environment will be wrong.  It may be easier to re-install than to try to fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to create a very simple IP that performs the following function on a block of data and returns the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y[d] = \\frac{5}{8} x[d]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is trivial.  It does not do much at all, but allows us to verify that the PL is actually modifying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that accepts a block of 16-bit data, performs the operation, and sends the result back.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file (because good tests improve development speed).\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works."

    "## Vivado HLS\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Start Vivado HLS.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vivado_hls\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " 1. Create a new project.\n",
    " 1. Create a top-level function called demodulate.\n",
    " 1. Create 2 new files:\n",
    "    * [demodulate.hpp](HLS/demodulate.hpp)\n",
    "    * [demodulate.cpp](HLS/demodulate.cpp)\n",
    " 1. Create a new test bench:\n",
    "    * [demodulate_test.cpp](HLS/demodulate_test.cpp)\n",
    " \n",
    "The important part of this module is to implement the AXI streaming interface in C++ that we will be using for the remainder of the projects.  There are two important steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Defining the C++ data types required for an AXI streaming interface.\n",
    " 1. Adding the HLS `pragma` entries to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#include <ap_axi_sdata.h>\n",
    "#include <hls_stream.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "#define BLOCK_SIZE 264\n",
    "\n",
    "typedef ap_axis<16,1,1,1> stream_type;\n",
    "\n",
    "void demodulate(stream_type input[BLOCK_SIZE], stream_type output[BLOCK_SIZE]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ap_axis` template type is specialized for a 16-bit transfer.  The three 1's are for fields we are not using, but which are required as they are part of the data type (User, ID and Dest).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also define the block size used for our transfers.  We are going to transfer 264 16-bit entries at a time.  Our audio data is 16-bit, 26.4k samples per second.  The sample size chosen provides 10ms of audio data.  We have two competing goals: maximize throughput efficiency and reduce latency.  We need low latency in order to quickly detect a carrier signal if one exists.  10ms is a reasonable compromise.  We can go lower given the performance of the FPGA, but for now we will use the 264 sample block size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the code and test bench are written, we need to run the C simulation, C synthesis, C/RTL co-simulation, then package the IP.  The two simulation steps run our test bench.  This verifies that the code will sythesize properly and that it functions properly.  For a software engineer, this is the same as compiling and running unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word of note regarding HLS -- Vivado HLS error messages can be rather opaque.  And Vivado HLS appears to be changing rapidly, so fixes to problems given 2-3 years ago may be out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the IP is packaged, we are done in HLS."
