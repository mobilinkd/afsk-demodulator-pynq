    "# AFSK Demodulator\n",
    "## Digital PLL\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline the steps necessary to move the Digital PLL to FPGA.  This will be our largest and most complex project yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to continue our migration of the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  We will be correlated data into the FPGA and streaming processed data out from the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fourth step of moving a demodulator processing step into the FPGA. At this point we have code to demodulate audio data in the FPGA.  We are left with clock recovery and HDLC framing.  Here we address clock recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we must diverge from the design pattern we have been following.  No longer are we simply streaming data in and out.  The PLL has to indicate *lock* status, it has to output a *sample* indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demodulated data (one bit at a time) will be clocked in via a stream interface.  This will be processed by the digital PLL.  The PLL will clock out 3 bits for each input sample: the demodulated bit, the a lock flag, and a sample indicator.  The sample indicator will never go high if the lock flag is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Python implementation of the PLL that we need an IIR filter and a hysteresis module.  We will build and test these independently.  The PLL also made use of floating point math in the PLL, IIR filter and hysteresis code.  We will change that to fixed point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "During the implementation, a number of issues arose around the complexity of the existing code which prevented an efficient implementation in the FPGA.  Two things in particular got in the way: division and the IIR filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid problems with the IIR filter, a very large fixed point type needed to be used.  We already have FIR filter code, so we adapted the PLL to use that instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the division operation in the the code path meant that there was a lot of PL resources being used and the latency was rather high.  The problem was rather easy to solve.  All of the divisions use an integral type between 1 and 128, which was later limited to 16.  A lookup table containing the inverse (1/n) values allows us to use a lookup and multiplication instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that came up is that with the used of fixed-point types, sizing the types for efficiency, including the integral and fractional portions, took a lot of thought.  With the fixed-point types sized properly, a rather efficient design was possible, and the HLS compiler seems to have done a really good job of optimizing the precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    " * Familiarized yourself with the AFSK demodulator implementation in Python.\n",
    " * Completed the first four steps of the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the process of creating a streaming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to modify the FPGA IP we created in the third tutorial to add the low-pass filter for the correlator output we are now generating, and turn that back into a bitstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that accepts a block of 16-bit data, performs the FIR, correlator and low-pass filter operations,  and sends the resulting bitstream back.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file.\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works.\n",
    " 1. Integrate the FPGA module with the existing demodulator code, replacing the existing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to generate the FIR filter coefficients.  Then we are going to generate some sample data for our test bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to generate the filter coefficents, because we still need to test against the Python implementation.  But we no longer need to print them out.  Our work with filters is complete.  We now focus on the digitl PLL."
