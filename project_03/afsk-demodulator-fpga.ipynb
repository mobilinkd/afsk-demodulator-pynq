    "## Step 2: Band Pass FIR Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will outline the steps necessary to move the band-pass FIR filter to FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is part of the [AFSK Demodulator on Pynq](afsk-demodulator-fpga.ipynb) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to serve as the foundation for migrating the Python demodulator code to FPGA.  We will be streaming audio data into the FPGA and streaming processed data out from the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first step of moving a demodulator processing step into the FPGA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you are expected to have:\n",
    "\n",
    " * A configured PYNQ environment.\n",
    " * Vivado installed on your computer and configured for your board.\n",
    " * Experience working through the tutorials at https://pynq.readthedocs.io/.\n",
    " * Familiarized yourself with the AFSK demodulator implementation in Python.\n",
    " * Completeed the first step of the tutorial to familiarize yourself with the process of creating a streaming interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to modify the IP we created in the first tutorial to do FIR processing.  We are going to use Python to generate the FIR coefficients (the same coefficients used in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform the following steps in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ file that accepts a block of 16-bit data, performs the FIR operation, and sends the result back.\n",
    " 1. Create a C++ test case for the above file (because good tests improve development speed).\n",
    " 1. Generate an IP package from the code that can be used in Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Create a Zynq project in Vivado that uses the IP.\n",
    " 1. Export the bitstream for our project from Vivado.\n",
    " 1. Use Python running on the PS to load the bitstream to the PL, and verify that it works.\n",
    " 1. Integrate the FIR filter with the existing demodulator code, replacing the existing Python BPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we are going to generate the FIR filter coefficients.  Then we are going to generate some sample data for our test bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Filter Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "With the code below we will generate and output the coefficients for the band pass filter."

We need low latency in order to quickly detect a carrier signal if one exists.  10ms is a reasonable compromise.  We can go lower given the performance of the FPGA, but for now we will use the 264 sample block size.\n",

    " 1. Give it a path -- in our case `afsk-demodulator-pynq/project_02` and the name `Vivado`.\n",
    " 1. Select the `RTL Project` project type.\n",
    " 1. In the \"Default Part\" screen, switch to the \"Boards\" tab. Select the your board from the list.\n",
    " 1. Click \"Finish\".\n",
    " \n",
    "With the new project open in Vivado, we need to create a block design.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. On the right side, in the Flow Navigator, select *Create Block Diagram*.\n",
    " 1. Use the default name, design_1.\n",
    " 1. Go into Tools|Settings.\n",
    "    1. In the settings dialog, choose IP|Repository.\n",
    "    1. Select \"+\" to add a repository.\n",
    "    1. Add Project_02/HLS as a repository.  You should see that it has 1 IP called `demodulate2` in there.\n",
    "    1. When done, click \"OK\".\n",
    " 1. In the Diagram view (main window) select \"+\" to add IP.\n",
    " 1. Add the Zynq processing system and run block automation.\n",
    " 1. When done, double-click the Zynq block and find the *High-performance AXI Slave Ports*.\n",
    " 1. Click on the High-performance AXI Slave Ports.\n",
    " 1. Enable the *S AXI HP0 interface*, then click OK.\n",
    " 1. Add an AXI Stream Interconnect, AXI Direct Memory Access and the demodulator IP.\n",
    " 1. Open the AXI Direct Memory Access, disable scatter/gather, and set the stream widths to 16 bits.\n",
    " 1. Wire up the demodulator to the AXI Direct Memory Access and run connection automation.\n",
